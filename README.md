# Problem Statement
Myself and hundreds of other students are few months away from finishing their Software Engineering Program at Moringa School. Many of us want to transition as quickly as possible into roles where we can put our newly acquired skills to use. However this is easier said than done. 

# Solution
This project is creating a job listing website to specifically list entry level opportunities in tech, startups and other comapnies. Users do not just go to the website to find roles they can apply to, but they also add jobs, including links to application pages.

## MVP

## How to Use the App

When you open the app on this link https://starlit-seahorse-a2ab4a.netlify.app/ you get to a landing page. Here you choose whether to upload a pic or work of art from your computer to the marketplace. Alternatively, you can choose to go straight to the Marketplace and see the pics there. 

You can switch through 3 pages on the navbar. However the content for this pages remain work in progress. Much of this remains work in progress.
