# Problem Statement
Myself and hundreds of other students are few months away from finishing their Software Engineering Program at Moringa School. Many of us want to transition as quickly as possible into roles where we can put our newly acquired skills to use. However this is easier said than done. 

# Solution
This project is creating a job listing website to specifically list entry level opportunities in tech, startups and other comapnies. Users do not just go to the website to find roles they can apply to, but they also add jobs, including links to application pages.

## MVP

<ul>
<li>
Home page
</li>
<li>
Submit a Job
</li>
</ul>

## How to Use the App

When you open the app on this link http://jobs4devs.vercel.app/ you get to a page listing jobs. These jobs are added either by a user or Admin to the database hosted at https://obscure-springs-19515.herokuapp.com/ 

When you click on a link it takes you to the application page for that job. Users can add a job by clicking on the submit a job navlink. However they need to log in by entering their name. If their name is not recognized they will have to add it first. 

Once they are logged in, a user can add and delete a job.
